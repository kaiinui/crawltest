crawltest
=========

Simplified test, which tests all pages return 200. (or sampled, listed URLs)

You can find that something went wrong with just checking response codes. (or inspect some elements)
This is the easiest way to test Rails app, and many people do it: the traditional method.

This is a experiment to test whether it works.
